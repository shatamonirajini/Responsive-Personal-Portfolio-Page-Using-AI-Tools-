# Responsive-Personal-Portfolio-Page-Using-AI-Tools-
This project is a fully responsive personal portfolio website created using only HTML and CSS as part of a web development assignment. The website includes a header with navigation links, a hero section with headline, description and a “Contact Me” button, a skills section displaying at least six skills, and a footer with social media links. The site is designed to be fully responsive with no horizontal scrolling: on desktop screens (≥1024px) the navigation appears in a row and the skills section is multi-column; on tablets (768–1023px) the layout reflows and the skills grid becomes two columns; on mobile devices (≤767px) the navigation stacks or becomes a hamburger menu and the skills section becomes a single column. The initial version of the website was generated using Lovable AI (lovable.dev) as per the assignment requirement, and the generated code was manually improved by enhancing the HTML structure, refining CSS, improving responsiveness, adjusting spacing, applying a custom color theme, adding hover effects and subtle animations, and ensuring clean, readable formatting. The project contains index.html, style.css, and README.md, and can be viewed by opening index.html in any browser without additional setup.
